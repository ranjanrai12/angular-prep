# What is karma and jasmine

Ans:

## Jasmine (Testing Framework)

It is A behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for testing JavaScript code

**Key features:**

- `describe`: describe function use to define test suite and it is collection of test case group together.

```js
describe('MyComponent Tests', () => {
  // Test cases go here
});
```

- `it`: it is an individual unit of tetsing that checks a specific aspect or behavior of a function, component, or service.

```js
it('should add two numbers correctly', () => {
  expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
});
```

`karma`- it is a tool to execute the test cases. When you run ng test in your Angular project, Karma is responsible for launching a browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and running your tests.
