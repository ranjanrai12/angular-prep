### Angular Module

The Angular Modules help us to organize our code into manageable parts, it helps in grouping together components, directives, pipe, service, modules that are related in functionality or purpose.

Syntax:

```
@NgModule({
  declarations: [  ],
  imports:      [  ],
  providers:    [  ],
  exports:      [  ],
  bootstrap:    [  ],
})
```
