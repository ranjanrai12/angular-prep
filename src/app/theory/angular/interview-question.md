#### What is angular and what are it's advantages ?

Angular is an open-source JavaScript framework written in TypeScript. Google controls this, and its main purpose is to develop single-page applications. Angular is a popular framework for building dynamic, responsive web applications. It provides several added functionalities, such as routing, HTTP requests, and form handling, saving developers much time and effort.

As a framework, Angular has distinct advantages, providing a standard structure for developers to work with. It allows users to build large-scale applications in a maintainable manner. Some of the common advantages of Angular are -

- It provides a firm opinion on how the application should be structured. It also offers bi-directional data flow and updates the real DOM.
- It consists of components, directives, pipes, and services, which help create applications smoother.
- Components dependent on other components can be easily worked around using Angular
- Other generic advantages include clean and maintainable code, unit testing, reusable components, data binding, and excellent responsive experience.

#### What is TypeScript? Why is it used in Angular?

TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript developed and maintained by Microsoft. Its primary goal is to enhance the maintainability, scalability, and reliability of JavaScript applications by adding optional types, classes, interfaces, and modules which helps in detecting potential issues during development time rather than at runtime. The core features of TypeScript include Static Typing, Classes and Interfaces, Decorators, TypeScript Compiler and Namespaces and Modules.

TypeScript is used in Angular because it provides better tooling support, improved type checking, and additional features like decorators, interfaces, etc.

#### Why we should use Angular?

#### What are data binding ? - `completed`

Ans: Check in the theory section

#### What are Single Page Applications ?

Single page application (SPA) is a web application that retrives all html, css, js with a single page load, And navigation between pages performed without refreshing the whole page

Pros:

- No page refresh
- Better user experience
- Ability to work offline

Cons:

- More complex to build
- SEO
- Initial load is slow
- Client should have javascript enabled

#### What is Server Side rendering ?

In server side rendering involves rendering web pages on the server and sending fully rendered HTML to the client's browser.

Benifits:

- improved SEO
- faster initial page loads
- better support for user with slow internet connection
